description: Interview me about the plan
---

Read the plan file and interview me using the AskUserQuestion tool.

Ask about: technical implementation, UI/UX (if applicable), concerns, tradeoffs.

Make sure the questions are not obvious.
Be very in-depth and continue until the plan is complete.
Finally, write the spec.
